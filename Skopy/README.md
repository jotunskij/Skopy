# Skopy
Skopy the dog

# Instruction unclarities
* Order of coordinates in .in file
* "The input file as a command.." unclear if content or file path
* ".. go after the next toy .." unclear if this is the next one in the list, or the closest one
* Unclear if the leash gets permanently attached to a tree, or if it can be undone (as in real life)
* Unclear if post should count as a tree (and hinder movement)

# Instructions
  *   One week from receipt of the test, mail program code and executable file that can handle as many of the tests in the attached zip file as possible to me, Ulf and Victor
  *   The attached Zip file contains two file types, .in and .ans
  *   .in files list trees and toy's coordinates where the first row first sets the number of toys and then the number of trees.
  *   .ans file contains the wanted answer.
  *   Selection of programming languages is up to you
  *   The program should be able to capture the input file as a command line argument or via a graphical interface and then present the response value
  *   How to run the program as an example should also be attached appropriately.

Here is the description text:

Your dog skopy is let loose in the park. Well, relatively loose - he is
tied to a post with a leash, limiting his movements. Spread around the
park are various squeaky toys and other dog paraphernalia, which Skopy
happily goes after when he sees them. When he gets to a toy he will chew
at it for a while until it has become defunct, at which point he will go
after the next toy, which looks much squeakier.
This is all very well, but there are obstacles to Skopy’s joyful canine
play: trees. In the park there are several trees, and if Skopy walks around
a tree his leash gets wrapped around the tree, making his movements more
limited. Being a dog, with pressing squeaky matters to attend to, Skopy
does not really have time to take things such as trees into account, and
always goes directly in a straight line for his next toy. If he can’t get
to his next toy because he has run out of leash, Skopy will start barking
uncontrollably (as no doubt any of us would) and you have to help him.
How long would Skopy’s leash have to be in order for him to run out of
toys before he runs out of leash?
For practical purposes, you may assume that (when seen from above)
Skopy, his toys, and the trees are points, and that the post that the leash
is tied to will not hinder Skopy’s movements in any way. If Skopy’s path
causes him to cross an earlier part of his leash he can safely walk over
it (he never crawls under it). The leash never gets tangled in itself. Af-
ter having finished chewing a toy, Skopy always goes for the most shiny
unchewed toy. The post to which Skopy’s leash is tied is located at co-
ordinates (0,0), and this is also where Skopy is initially located.
